# Generate-Odd-If
Created by: Spencer Burchfield
Date: 10/29/24
This program writes to another file which checks if a number is even or odd. (Without MOD %)
   The reason is because it was a demonstration that you can write python in a
   python file using python from a different file. 
   I understand that the created program is not practical in any way. It was 
   inspired by comical programming TikToks from 2020.

Special Notes *
-  using if instead of elif; 
-  Although it would be more efficient, it throws a memory error.
